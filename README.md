# MinecraftLogger
A logger for minecraft version 1.21.1. This is for **educational use ONLY**! This is to show how easy it is to log information and to push the idea of checking code before running. I am not responsible for the use of this code use at your own risk.

## What does it log?
- User IGN & UUID

- System Name
- System OS & OS Version
- Java Version & Vendor
- Java Home Location
- User Home Location
- File Encoding
- System Language
- System Country
- User Internal & External IP

## Why?
I cannot specifiy this enough, please check minecraft mods before running. 2 Classes is all it takes to potentially have your personal information stolen.
